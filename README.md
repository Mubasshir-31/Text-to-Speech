# Text-to-Speech
Text to Speech is a web application that converts written text into spoken words using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
The project provides a user-friendly interface where users can input text and listen to it being read aloud,
utilizing the browser's built-in speech synthesis capabilities.
